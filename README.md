## How To Use It

Add a new repository on your Maven project (please refer to [https://jitpack.io](https://jitpack.io) if you want to add it by using Gradle):

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

Then add the dependency.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.thiagodnf</groupId>
    <artifactId>genetic-algorithm</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.3</version>
</dependency>
```

Now you can import the class on your project.

```java

```

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously, this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications for free! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, reach out to me if you want to do it.

Thanks!

❤️
